# Webpage Editor

This is a small and easy webpage editor for the homepage of [Jana Goellner](https://github.com/Tschuck/homepage-jana-goellner).

It offers the possibility to import and export json definitions. The definition consists of pages and each page has a specific layout type. Each layout comes with different properties like a markdown text and images (or a subset of page definitions for the cards layout (aka blog)).

**Please be aware, that this is not a production ready editor. Its just for providing an easy, CMS like, editor for the owner of the page.**

Homepage for a midwife and Alternative practitioner from germany, thuringia. Visit the deployed homepage here:
